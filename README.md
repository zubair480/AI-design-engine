# 🏡 EstateAgent AI: Hyper-Local Real Estate Intelligence

**EstateAgent AI** is a high-performance, multi-agent swarm system designed to evaluate real estate investment opportunities across multiple regions simultaneously. By leveraging a "Swarm" architecture on serverless infrastructure, the system orchestrates parallel AI agents—each acting as a dedicated local expert—to provide data-driven investment scores and strategic insights in seconds.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Parallel Swarm Analysis:** Automatically spins up $N$ analyst instances (one per target region) to process massive market datasets in parallel.
* **📊 Standardized Investment Scoring:** Every analysis yields a structured score out of **100**, categorized by:
* **ROI Potential (0-50):** Profitability and growth upside.
* **Feasibility (0-30):** Market entry ease and local constraints.
* **Risk Mitigation (0-20):** Downside protection and market volatility.


* **🌐 Real-Time Web Dashboard:** A built-in `modal serve` frontend featuring live agent progress tracking, AI-generated strategic analysis, and profit distribution histograms.
* **☁️ Serverless Scaling:** Built on **Modal**, allowing the swarm to scale from one region to hundreds instantly without managing infrastructure.

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. **The Planner:** Receives the global objective (e.g., *"Find the best coffee shop locations in London"*) and the investment budget.
2. **The Orchestrator:** Distributes regional data and specific instructions to the swarm.
3. **The Swarm (Analyst Agents):** Individual AI agents process local market data, evaluate feasibility, and generate structured JSON outputs.
4. **The Synthesizer:** Aggregates swarm data into a visual dashboard and a high-level strategic report.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A [Modal](https://modal.com) account

### Installation

```bash
pip install modal
modal setup

```

### Usage

#### 1️⃣ Test via CLI

Run a quick analysis directly from your terminal:

```bash
modal run app.py --prompt "Design a profitable coffee shop portfolio"

```

#### 2️⃣ Run Web Demo (Real-Time UI)

Launch the interactive dashboard to watch the agents work in real-time:

```bash
modal serve app.py

```

*→ Open the generated URL in your browser to see the live swarm, histograms, and strategic analysis.*

#### 3️⃣ Deploy to Production

Deploy the app as a permanent public URL:

```bash
modal deploy app.py

```

## 📉 Scoring Methodology

To ensure objective comparisons across diverse markets, **EstateAgent AI** uses a strict 100-point rubric:

| Category | Weight | Focus Area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ROI Potential** | 50 pts | Yield, Appreciation, Local Demand |
| **Feasibility** | 30 pts | Regulations, Zoning, Development Cost |
| **Risk Mitigation** | 20 pts | Market Saturation, Economic Stability |
