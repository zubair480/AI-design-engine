# 🏡 EstateAgent AI: Hyper-Local Real Estate Intelligence

EstateAgent AI is a high-performance, multi-agent swarm system designed to evaluate real estate investment opportunities across multiple regions simultaneously. By leveraging a "Swarm" architecture on serverless infrastructure, the system orchestrates parallel AI agents—each acting as a dedicated local expert—to provide data-driven investment scores and strategic insights in seconds.

## 🧠 The Intelligence Engine

Unlike simple wrappers, EstateAgent AI uses a sophisticated multi-model pipeline to ensure reliability and depth:

* **Primary Brain:** **Qwen 2.5 (7B-Instruct)** hosted via **vLLM on Modal (H100 GPUs)**. This serves as the Planner, Analyst Swarm node, and Conclusion Advisor.
* **Fail-Safe Routing:** **Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B)** running on **Cloudflare Workers AI** acts as a high-speed fallback for prompt classification and to mitigate cold starts.
* **Semantic Memory:** **BGE Base (en-v1.5)** embedded into **Cloudflare Vectorize** allows the system to query historical investment memos via natural language.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Parallel Swarm Analysis:** Utilizes Modal’s container fan-out to spin up $N$ analysts simultaneously, processing massive datasets in seconds.
* **🛡️ Secure Execution:** Python code generated by the agents is executed within a **gVisor sandbox** for maximum security and isolation.
* **📊 Standardized Scoring (The 100-Point Rubric):**
* **ROI Potential (0-50):** Yield, appreciation, and local demand.
* **Feasibility (0-30):** Regulations, zoning, and development costs.
* **Risk Mitigation (0-20):** Market saturation and economic stability.


* **🌐 Real-Time Streaming UI:** A React frontend powered by **Cloudflare Durable Objects** for low-latency event streaming as the swarm works.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

1. **The Planner (Qwen 2.5):** Deconstructs the global objective into regional tasks.
2. **The Orchestrator:** Manages the parallel fan-out to Modal containers.
3. **The Swarm (Analyst Agents):** Individual nodes process local market data and generate structured JSON.
4. **The Map-Reduce Pipeline:** Results are aggregated, cross-referenced with historical data via Vectorize, and synthesized into a final report.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A [Modal](https://modal.com) account & [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account

### Installation

```bash
pip install modal
modal setup

```

### Usage

**1️⃣ Run Web Demo (Real-Time UI)**
Launch the interactive dashboard to watch the agents work, view profit histograms, and see live strategic analysis:

```bash
modal serve app.py

```

**2️⃣ Test via CLI**

```bash
modal run app.py --prompt "Analyze luxury residential potential in Tokyo vs. Singapore"

```

**3️⃣ Deploy to Production**

```bash
modal deploy app.py

```
